# tlodotfiles

A bunch of dot-files.

## Notes

* For system-wide configurations, put configurations:
    * In /etc/bash.bashrc instead of in "${HOME}/.bashrc"
    * In /etc/gitconfig instead of in "${HOME}/.gitconfig"
    * In /etc/screenrc or /usr/local/etc/screenrc instead of in "${HOME}/.screenrc"
        * Check the CUSTOMIZATION or FILES section in "man screen" for the correct path
    * In /etc/vimrc instead of in "${HOME}/.vimrc"
