# tlodotfiles

A bunch of dot-files.

## Notes

* For system-wide configurations, put configurations:
    * In /etc/ssh_config instead of in ~/.ssh/config
    * In /etc/bash.bashrc instead of in ~/.bashrc
    * In /etc/gitconfig instead of in ~/.gitconfig
    * In /etc/screenrc or /usr/local/etc/screenrc instead of in ~/.screenrc
        * Check the CUSTOMIZATION or FILES section in "man screen" for the correct path
    * In /etc/vimrc instead of in ~/.vimrc
